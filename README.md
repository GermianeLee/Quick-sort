# Quick-sort
The QuickSort.java program implements the QuickSort algorithm, a highly efficient, divide, and-conquer sorting technique. 
It works by selecting a pivot element from the array, partitioning the remaining elements into two subarrays, those less
than or equal to the pivot and those greater than the pivotâ€”and then recursively sorting each subarray. Once all recursive
calls complete, the array is fully sorted in ascending (or descending) order. QuickSort is favored for its average-case time
complexity of O(n log n) and in-place sorting capability, making it both fast and memory-efficient.
